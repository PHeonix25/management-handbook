# THANKS

There are so many people I need to thank, that have taught me different bits and peices of this management handbook over time and have helped me to clarify/train/focus on my own strengths and weaknesses.

Most of these people know who they are, and a lot of this is driven from my previous managers and peers, but some of their work is more public than others.

If they have published their work (_or I have stolen something verbatim from the internets_), then I'll link it below, along with credit to the original author -- _or the person I stole it from at least..._

  * Questions for our syncs, as mentioned in the section: [Getting to know you](/now-the-real-stuff/templates/gettingtoknowyou.md).
  * So many other things I've probably forgotten, sorry.

  * Her book, [The Managers Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=as_li_ss_tl), is just amazing for all levels of management. Read it!
