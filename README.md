# Introduction

![Built with Love](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)

This is my **Manager Readme**: a handbook for setting expectations between us; just you and me.

In this document, I will try and be myself, presented through text -- with the help of some emojis along the way... This should be expected from you if we're going to properly build trust.

![You didn't ask for this](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/you-didnt-ask-for-this.svg)

You didn't ask for me to make this, but I made it for you. Well, more accurately, I made it for **us**.

I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and this document is not intended to replace the in-person relationship or mutual understanding that we will build over time. The intention of this document is to give you an idea of how I think, and how I work! So, let's work through it, and I hope that you can use this as an accurate "reference guide" to me as a person, my expectations, and the way I manage...

![Pretty Risque](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/pretty-risque.svg)

If you've met me in person, you'd well know that I can be crude, loud and (_hopefully, only sometimes_) obnoxious! Well, as a result, this document is too.

You'll also notice that I'm not scared to have a discussion about just about any topic and if you ask, I will (try and) give you a straight answer. Some people call this [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/about-radical-candor/). I prefer the terms "open, honest and direct" -- which is also (_not-so coincidentally_) one of the slogans of my current employer!

_PLEASE NOTE: **This is unashamedly a work-in-progress**_.

I've been holding onto this document in draft form for far too long; it's time to _just ship it_! <img height="40px" src="https://hermens.com.au/assets/shipit.png" alt="Shipit Squirrel"/>

This book will change over time, as I learn, develop and change my style. While I don't expect it to change often, I'm sure there will be constant tweaks.
