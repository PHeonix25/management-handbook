# I am Pat Hermens

I have a lot more info over on [my personal site](https://hermens.com.au/about), but I'll copy the abstract over here for those that don't want to click through:

> I’m a loud Australian that’s been living in the Netherlands for a few years – and still trying to learn Dutch. At risk of sounding cliché; I’m an skilled .Net developer, experienced public speaker, husband and father, but most of all, a geek. Over the course of my career, I’ve found that interesting problems & inspiring solutions are what gets me out of bed in the morning.

I think that tells *most* of the story, but it's probably worth highlighting for you that I enjoy addressing crowds, I'm not scared to stand up and fight for what I think is right, I want to get more under-represented demographics into tech, and I want to make the world better for my kids.

I believe that this doesn't make me a Leftie, or a Feminist, or a Hippy, or whatever other title you want to come up with... I think this just makes me **a good person**™.

I try and live my life by solving problems, and not just technical ones (although those are by far the easiest to solve). This means that I can sometimes try and give you a solution to your problem, even if you didn't ask for one. _Just ask my wife._ If you think that I'm overstepping what you need from me, please, just let me know.

_**TODO:** Insert the life-story-line-thing from the session with Saskia._

Seeing as you're reading this, I would assume that soon we will have our 1:1 sync; make sure if there's anything you want to know, you ask. The egotistical part of me loves to tell a good story.

If you're not working with me and you want to know more, that's also fine! My DM's are open on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phermens), you can request to join [my Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/hermens/shared_invite/enQtMzc0MTE2NTU2Mzg0LTg4NWIyNjcwMGEwNWVjMmM5YzA0OTFiNWE1MWYwMzEzNzNiM2JkMGY2YzY3ZmJkZjgwNDY1ZjNkZmQwMDNkMmM), or just [email me](mailto:p@hermens.com.au).
